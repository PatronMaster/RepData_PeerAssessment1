## Synopsis

Climatic events have an impact on the population health and economic
consequences worldwide.

Using the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrationâ€™s (NOAA) Storm
Database we can measure the impact of most weather harmful events on US.

I concluded the most impact events are Tornado and flood.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Support packages & options

I used for this investigation the following:

| Software | Value                        |
|----------|------------------------------|
| platform | x86\_64-pc-linux-gnu         |
| arch     | x86\_64                      |
| os       | linux-gnu                    |
| language | R                            |
| version  | R version 4.0.3 (2020-10-10) |

The support packages are:

``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(R.utils)
library(data.table)
library(DT)
library(knitr)
library(ggplot2)
library(plotly)
options(scipen=999)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Data Processing

### READ data

First, I am Read the data for that I need:

-   Uncompress
-   Read in my case using read\_csv

Fread can make the Uncompress and read at same time.

``` r
StormData <- fread("Data_2/repdata_data_StormData.csv.bz2")
```

### Showing the head of data

The table below have first 20 rows of raw data (you can play with the
table, this is a dynamic table).

``` r
datatable(StormData[1:20,])
```

    ## PhantomJS not found. You can install it with webshot::install_phantomjs(). If it is installed, please make sure the phantomjs executable can be found via the PATH variable.

### Transforming the data PROPDMGEXP and CROPDMGEXP

The columns PROPDMGEXP and CROPDMGEXP need some transformation. This
because we have letters inside. Please check below table for more
details.

``` r
datatable(as.data.frame(table(StormData$PROPDMGEXP)))
```

<!--html_preserve-->

<div id="htmlwidget-75815cd69863b0098e7f" class="datatables html-widget"

</div>

<script type="application/json" data-for="htmlwidget-75815cd69863b0098e7f">{"x":{"filter":"none","data":[["1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8","9","10","11","12","13","14","15","16","17","18","19"],["","-","?","+","0","1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8","B","h","H","K","m","M"],[465934,1,8,5,216,25,13,4,4,28,4,5,1,40,1,6,424665,7,11330]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th> <\/th>\n      <th>Var1<\/th>\n      <th>Freq<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"columnDefs":[{"className":"dt-right","targets":2},{"orderable":false,"targets":0}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>
<!--/html_preserve-->

So, I need replace the letters by the right values for that I created a
function called Economic\_Losses that will receive a letter or number
and will return like this:

-   , return 0

-   -, return 0

-   ?, return 0

-   +, return 1

-   h, return 100

-   k, return 1000

-   m, return 1000000

-   b, return 1000000000

-   Other value, same value

``` r
tmp<-StormData
Economic_Losses <- function(variable) {
  if (variable=="") {
    return(0)
  }
    switch(variable,
           "-"=return(0),
           "?"=return(0),
           "+"=return(1),
           "h"=return(100),
           "k"=return(1000),
           "m"=return(1000000),
           "b"=return(1000000000),
           return(variable)
    )
}
tmp$PROPDMGEXP<-as.character(tolower(tmp$PROPDMGEXP))
tmp$PROPDMGEXP<-as.numeric(lapply(tmp$PROPDMGEXP,Economic_Losses))
tmp$CROPDMGEXP<-as.character(tolower(tmp$CROPDMGEXP))
tmp$CROPDMGEXP<-as.numeric(lapply(tmp$CROPDMGEXP,Economic_Losses))

tmp<-tmp %>% 
    mutate(PROPDMG_T=PROPDMG*PROPDMGEXP) %>% 
    mutate(CROPDMG_T=CROPDMG*CROPDMGEXP)
```

After transformation now is just have numbers.

``` r
datatable(as.data.frame(table(tmp$PROPDMGEXP)))
```

### Calculation of TOP 10 most harmful events

First I group by EVTYPE

``` r
StormData_group<- tmp %>% 
    group_by(EVTYPE)
```

Then I summarise and pick only 10 most most harmful events

**Note:** I also need to sum the columns FATALITIES and INJURIES

``` r
StormData_summarise<-StormData_group %>% 
    summarise(FATALITIES=sum(FATALITIES),INJURIES=sum(INJURIES)) %>%
    mutate(Total=FATALITIES+INJURIES)

StormData_TOP10<-StormData_summarise[order(StormData_summarise$Total,decreasing = TRUE),][1:10,]
StormData.long<-melt(StormData_TOP10[,1:3],id.vars="EVTYPE")
```

The output after transformation StormData summarize

``` r
datatable(StormData_summarise)
```

## Results

We can easily verify the most harmful events with respect to population
health is Tornado. We also can verify on below images the fatalities and
injuries both have the tornado as harmful event.

Related with most harmful events with respect to economic consequences
the flood is most harmful. We can verify the crop is more affected by
drought then flood.
